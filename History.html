					<p>New Trier was founded in 1901. It had a whopping student body of 76 students. The school boasts some grand accomplishments such asin 1913 being the first school to have an indoor swimming pool.</p>
<p>As the school got larger and larger, they decided to open up New Trier West, a freshmen and sophomore campus. Enrolment peaked in 1972 with 6,558 students, but fell significantly in 1981, leading to New Trier West being demoted to a freshmen only campus. </p>
<p>The school has gone through many renovations over the years, most notably in 2017 with a 104 million dollar renovation for the East campus, replacing much of the oldest part of the school, and adding important STEM infrastructure. This renovation continues today with the gym currently being completely redone at the East campus.</p>
<p>The school has had a rocky past when it comes to race issues. Being that the school is heavily white, there is a large effort to have the student better understand racial issues. Parents often are at the ends of these conversations being had. This happens almost yearly during a day called Seminar day, which lets students pick seminars they are interested in. </p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to seminar day, it is common for school board meetings to have every seat filled, with dozens of parents trying to get their say in.</p>
