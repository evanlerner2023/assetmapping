A lot of students have quite high levels of involvement in the school. Many to the point of potential detriment to their grades. One student seemed to be struggling quite a lot with the new content. I went up to my mentor teacher and she told me that the student had a big play coming up, and that was holding them back.
</p>
In college, I always learned about how important school work was, and that no matter what sport or activity I did, the activity should not get in the way of school work. This seemed to not be the case for all of the students. College was a main concern for them, especially the juniors. Therefore, they felt they needed to do as many marketable activities as possible.
<p>
Students who like the subject tend to do much better. Regardless of other activities or backgrounds, the students who claim they like math excel in class. I am not sure whether this is a feedback loop, as in the students are doing well, so they are more engaged, so they do better, or if they simply like the subject because they are doing well. Either way, getting the students to like the subject seems quite beneficial.
</p>
<p>
My teacher was talking with a student after class. This particular student was doing bad on the last few quizzes, then got 100% on the last test. The teacher was inquiring as to why this happened. The student talked about outside tutoring and the math resource center at New Trier. He said that using those resources helped him excel and move his grade up. I think it is really important to ask these questions as a teacher, so that one can better gauge what resources can help students who are struggling with a certain subject.
</p>
<p>
Overall, students have many varied experiences, all of which are valuable to access in order to create the most equitable environment possible.
