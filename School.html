							<p>Our school has quite an active student body when it comes to asset mappings. Not only is there a school newspaper, there is also a parody newspaper written by the students. Focusing on the school newspaper, it covers everything from in school events, to world wide politics. The paper also does not shy away from opinions, allowing students to voice their opinion on topics which interest them.</p>
	<p>The school has a great website that is easily accessible for both students and teachers. The popdown menu has everything categorized in a quite practical method, allowing students to easily find whatever they need, whether it be upcoming events, tech help, or how their block schedule works. In fact, there is an app students can download (which I see a lot of students use), which shows them the current schedule of the day, what classes they have, and how many minutes are left in that particular period. This app was created by a New Trier teacher.</p>
	<p>Parents have two main opportunities to interact with teachers. They have parent teacher conferences, which give every parent 5 minutes with all of their students' teachers. There is also bring your parents to school at night, in which students go through the entire school day with their parents (although I have heard the rooms can become crowded). </p>
	<p>There are plenty of clubs that a student (or teacher) can become involved in. These include clubs that support the community, such as meals on wheels, or other fundraising clubs which helps those in need. </p>
	<p>It would be impossible for me to list all of the extracurricular activities at New Trier. They have a club finder app (also made by a New Trier teacher), of which has about 12 pages. I visited the math club, and was quite happy to see the students actively enjoying their math activity. Many teachers were around to help the students through their particular math problems. This was a great way for students to not only improve their math skills, but connect with each other and get help from their teachers.</p>
