<p>There are plenty of libraries close to New Trier. This includes two libraries in Evanston, a library in Glenview, and Wilmette. I have been to all of these libraries to meet with and tutor students. Speaking of tutoring, a quick online search at Nextdoor Neighbor reveals hundreds of tutors in the area, many of which being current or former teachers.</p>
<p>The school is embroiled with fierce political changes brought upon by rather vocal advocates. My neighbor has said several times that they are tired of the CRT being taught in school, and want to run for the school board. There are big pushes to have heavily conservative candidates on the New Trier school board, which usually leans slightly left of center.</p>
<p>There are plenty of jobs around the area. It is common for students to work a shift after school at a dinner shop. Even more common is for students to become camp counselors over the summer.</p>
<p>That being said, students have little time for recreation after school. They are often working, doing school work, playing a sport, or doing a club. That being said, I have seen students at Old Orchard mall, public parks, and at LifeTime fitness. Many do find time for recreational activity. </p>
<p>After school, it is impossible to get into the 7-Eleven near campus. It is utterly packed with students thirsting for a diet coke or a pack of M&Ms.</p>
